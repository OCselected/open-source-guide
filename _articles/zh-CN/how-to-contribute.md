为开源贡献力量，得到的回报就是能够学习到很多、受教很多、且能够锻炼任何你能够想到的经验。

为什么会有人为开源做贡献？这可能是很多人都不明白的地方，这里不妨列出一些！

### 巩固现有技能

无论是撰写代码、设计用户界面、图形设计、撰写文档、亦或是组织活动，假如你有实践的愿望，你总能在开源项目中找到自己的位置。

### 遇见那些和你“臭味相投”的人

开源项目一般都会有一个和谐、热心的社区，以让大家团结一致。实际上，开源界经常发生这样的情形，很多人的深厚友谊都是通过共同参与开源所建立起来的，至于具体的方式，可能是在一次技术研讨会上相谈甚欢，也可能是一直在聊天室中探讨问题。

### 寻找导师，并且尝试帮助他人

和他人共同在一个共享的项目下工作，这意味着需要向他人解释清楚自己是如何做的，同理，也需要向他人求助，询问别人是如何做的。相互学习和彼此教学对于每位参与者都能满载而归。

### 在公众间建立你的声誉（职业口碑）

根据开源的定义，你在开源下所有的工作都是公开的，这也就意味着开源项目是一个很好展示你实力的地方。

### 学习领导和管理的艺术

开源为实践领导力和管理技能提供了很好的机会，比如解决冲突、组织团队、工作的优先级排列。

### 鼓励作出改变，哪怕改变是很微小的

在开源的世界里，作出贡献的不一定非得是花了很长时间拥有大量经验的人。你是否遇到过浏览某些网站发现有拼写错误，希望有人能修改它？其实，在开源的项目中，你只需要做就可以了。没有那么多的顾忌，开源让人们在很舒服的状态做事，而这才是这个世界应有的体验。

## 贡献的具体含义是什么

如果你是一名开源界的新手，可能会对贡献的流程心生畏惧。比如：该如何找到正确的项目？不懂编码又想参与怎么办？万一做错事情了怎么办？

其实没有关系的啦！条条大路通罗马，开源项目有太多的路径可以参与！以下是一些实用的技巧，帮助你快速的获得经验。

### 你不具备编码的能力

对于为开源做贡献常见的误解就是：为开源做贡献必须得提交代码。事实上，代码固然重要，但是项目中不需编码的重要部分[经常被忽视](https://github.com/blog/2195-the-shape-of-open-source)。你若做了这部分，对于项目来说可是莫大的贡献，而这根本就不需要什么撰写代码！

即使你是以为开发者，非代码的贡献对于项目来说也是举足轻重的，尤其是对于社区的其他成员来说。用心维系这些关系能够让你有工作到项目其它部分的机会。

### 是否热衷于规划事件？

* 为项目组织研讨会或线下分享，[一如 @fzamperin 为 NodeSchool 所做的那样](https://github.com/nodeschool/organizers/issues/406)
* 为项目组织大型会议（假如它有的话）
* 帮助社区成员寻找合适的技术会议，且帮助有实力的成员提交演讲的拟稿

### 是否偏向于设计？
* 重新布置布局以提高项目的可用性
* 进行用户研究以重新组织和完善项目的导航或菜单
* 整理一个风格指南，以帮助项目有一致的视觉设计
* 创建t恤的艺术或一个新的标志，[就像 hapi.js 的贡献者那样](https://github.com/hapijs/contrib/issues/68)

### 你是否热衷于写作？

* 撰写和改进项目的文档
* 能够以实例来展示项目该如何使用的
* 为项目撰写新闻稿，或者到邮件列表高调布道
* 为项目撰写教程， [一如 pypa 的贡献者所做的](https://github.com/pypa/python-packaging-user-guide/issues/194)

</aside>

### 你喜欢组织活动吗？
* 链接重复的问题，并建议新的问题标签，使事物井井有条
* 通过开放的问题，并建议关闭旧的，[就像 @nzakas 为 eslint 做的](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/6765)
* 把最近开放的问题阐述清晰，以推动讨论

### 享受编码的乐趣？

* 找到一个开放的问题并解决它，[就像 @dianjin 为 Leaflet 做的](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/issues/4528#issuecomment-216520560)
* 想一想你是否可以帮忙写一个新的功能
* 自动化项目设置
* 改进工具和测试

### 热衷于帮助他人？

* 回答关于项目的问题，例如在 Stack Overflow（[像 Postgres 的这个示例](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18664074/getting-error-peer-authentication-failed-for-user-postgres-when-to-ge)）或者 reddit 上
* 为人们解答公开的问题
* 帮助缓和讨论板或对话渠道

### 在编码方面是否喜欢帮助他人？

* 为他人的提交审核代码
* 为如何利用项目撰写教程
* 为其他贡献者做导师， [正如 @ereichert 为 @bronzdoc 所做的那样，哦，是 Rust 项目](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/123#issuecomment-238049666)

### 其实不必一定是软件项目！

尽管人们一提起“开源”二字，默认就是指开源软件，其实不尽然，开源可以是任何事情的修饰，而不仅仅是指软件而言的。比如图书、食谱、列表、以及任何可以开源的项目类。

举例来说：

* @sindresorhus 创建了 ["惊奇" 列表](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
* @h5bp 维护了针对前端开发者的[面试题](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions)
* @stuartlynn 和 @nicole-a-tesla 制作了[收集关于海雀的有趣的事实](https://github.com/stuartlynn/puffin_facts)

尽管你是一名软件开发者，也可以去撰写一些文档去帮助新的入门者。其实项目中那些看起来令人生畏的项目并不是写代码，做开发者总得挑战自己，其实在做得过程中可以增强信心和获得全新的体验。

## 根据项目定位自我

</aside>

为开源做贡献，除了单词拼写错误之外，大多数时候就像是走在陌生人中间，浑身上下不适。这就像人们已经在西边讨论的非常深入了，你突然开始讲东，肯定会让人感到不舒服。

与其盲目的在项目中游荡，不如静下心来学习规则。这样反而会让你的想法被注意到，也会有人听到你的声音。

### 分析感兴趣的开源项目

每一个开源社区都是不一样的。

Spending years on one open source project means you've gotten to know one open source project. Move to a different project, and you might find the vocabulary, norms, and communication styles are completely different.

That said, many open source projects follow a similar organizational structure. Understanding the different community roles and overall process will help you get quickly oriented to any new project.

A typical open source project has the following types of people:

* **作者:** The person/s or organization that created the project
* **归属者:** The person/s who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository (not always the same as the original author)
* **维护者:** Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. (They may also be authors or owners of the project.)
* **贡献者:** Everyone who has contributed something back to the project.
* **社区成员:** People who use the project. They might be active in conversations or express their opinion on the project's direction.

Bigger projects may also have subcommittees or working groups focused on different tasks, such as tooling, triage, community moderation, and event organizing. Look on a project's website for a "team" page, or in the repository for governance documentation, to find this information.

A project also has documentation. These files are usually listed in the top level of a repository.

* **LICENSE:** By definition, every open source project must have an [open source license](https://choosealicense.com). If the project does not have a license, it is not open source.
* **README:** The README is the instruction manual that welcomes new community members to the project. It explains why the project is useful and how to get started.
* **CONTRIBUTING:** Whereas READMES help people _use_ the project, contributing docs help people _contribute_ to the project. It explains what types of contributions are needed and how the process works. While not every project has a CONTRIBUTING file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
* **CODE_OF_CONDUCT:** The code of conduct sets ground rules for participants' behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. While not every project has a CODE_OF_CONDUCT file, its presence signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to.
* **Other documentation:** There might be additional documentation, such as tutorials, walkthroughs, or governance policies, especially on bigger projects.

Finally, open source projects use the following tools to organize discussion. Reading through the archives will give you a good picture of how the community thinks and works.

* **Issue tracker:** Where people discuss issues related to the project.
* **Pull requests:** Where people discuss and review changes that are in progress.
* **Discussion forums or mailing lists:** Some projects may use these channels for conversational topics (ex. _"How do I..."_ or _"What do you think about..."_ instead of bug reports or feature requests). Others use the issue tracker for all conversations.
* **Synchronous chat channel:** Some projects use chat channels (such as Slack or IRC) for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exchanges.

## 寻找打算做贡献的项目

Now that you've figured out how open source projects work, it's time to find a project to contribute to!

If you've never contributed to open source before, take some advice from U.S. President John F. Kennedy, who once said, _"Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country."_

Contributing to open source happens at all levels, across projects. You don't need to overthink what exactly your first contribution will be, or how it will look.

Instead, start by thinking about the projects you already use, or want to use. The projects you'll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to.

Within those projects, whenever you catch yourself thinking that something could be better or different, act on your instinct.

Open source isn't an exclusive club; it's made by people just like you. "Open source" is just a fancy term for treating the world's problems as fixable.

You might scan a README and find a broken link or a typo. Or you're a new user and you noticed something is broken, or an issue that you think should really be in the documentation. Instead of ignoring it and moving on, or asking someone else to fix it, see whether you can help out by pitching in. That's what open source is all about!

> [28% of casual contributions](http://www.igor.pro.br/publica/papers/saner2016.pdf) to open source are documentation, such as a typo fix, reformatting, or writing a translation.

### 提交贡献之前应做的检查列表

When you've found a project you'd like to contribute to, do a quick scan to make sure that the project is suitable for accepting contributions. Otherwise, your hard work may never get a response.

Here's a handy checklist to evaluate whether a project is good for new contributors.

**符合开源的定义**

<div class="clearfix mb-2">
  <input type="checkbox" id="cbox1" class="d-block float-left mt-1 mr-2" value="checkbox">
  <label for="cbox1" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">
  有许可协议吗？通常情况下，会在根目录有一个叫做 LICENSE 的文件。
  </label>
</div>

**项目被接收的提交活跃度**

在主干上确认提交的活跃度。在GitHub上托管的开源项目，你可以在仓库主页上看到这些信息。

<div class="clearfix mb-2">
  <input type="checkbox" id="cbox2" class="d-block float-left mt-1 mr-2" value="checkbox">
  <label for="cbox2" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">
  最后一次提交是在什么时候？
  </label>
</div>

<div class="clearfix mb-2">
  <input type="checkbox" id="cbox3" class="d-block float-left mt-1 mr-2" value="checkbox">
  <label for="cbox3" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">
  项目目前有多少贡献者？
  </label>
</div>

<div class="clearfix mb-4">
  <input type="checkbox" id="cbox4" class="d-block float-left mt-1 mr-2" value="checkbox">
  <label for="cbox4" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">
  人们提交的频繁吗？ (在 GitHub，可以在顶栏里点击“commits”来展现。）
  </label>
</div>

接下来，就是看项目的 issue 数量。

<div class="clearfix mb-2">
  <input type="checkbox" id="cbox5" class="d-block float-left mt-1 mr-2" value="checkbox">
  <label for="cbox5" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">

  </label>
</div>

<div class="clearfix mb-2">

  <label for="cbox9" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">
    有没有关闭的issue？ (在 GitHub, 点击 "closed" 标签就可以看到所有已经关闭的issue。)
  </label>
</div>

同样再来看看 PR的情形。

<div class="clearfix mb-2">
  <input type="checkbox" id="cbox10" class="d-block float-left mt-1 mr-2" value="checkbox">
  <label for="cbox8" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">

  <label for="cbox13" class="overflow-hidden d-block text-normal">
    最近有多少PR合并？ (在 GitHub, 点击 RP页面的 "closed" 的标签页来查看已经关闭的标签页。)
  </label>
</div>

**项目的受欢迎程度**

一个项目的友好程度和受欢迎意味着更能吸引新的贡献者。


<div class="clearfix mb-2">

  Whenever you see a long thread, spot check responses from core developers coming late in the thread. Are they summarizing constructively, and taking steps to bring the thread to a decision while remaining polite? If you see a lot of flame wars going on, that's often a sign that energy is going into argument instead of into development.

## 如何提交成果

You've found a project you like, and you're ready to make a contribution. Finally! Here's how to get your contribution in the right way.

### 有效沟通

Whether you're a one-time contributor or trying to join a community, working with others is one of the most important skills you'll develop in open source.

<aside markdown="1" class="pquote">
  <img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/7693422?v=3&s=460" class="pquote-avatar" alt="avatar">
  \[As a new contributor,\] I quickly realized I had to ask questions if I wanted to be able to close the issue. I skimmed through the code base. Once I had some sense of what was going on, I asked for more direction. And voilà! I was able to solve the issue after getting all the relevant details I needed.
  <p markdown="1" class="pquote-credit">

  </p>
</aside>

Before you open an issue or pull request, or ask a question in chat, keep these points in mind to help your ideas come across effectively.

**Give context.** Help others get quickly up to speed. If you're running into an error, explain what you're trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you're suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it'd be useful to the project (not just to you!).

> 😇 _"X doesn't happen when I do Y"_
>
> 😢 _"X is broken! Please fix it."_

**Do your homework beforehand.** It's ok not to know things, but show that you tried. Before asking for help, be sure to check a project's README, documentation, issues (open or closed), mailing list, and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate when you demonstrate that you're trying to learn.

> 😇 _"I'm not sure how to implement X. I checked the help docs and didn't find any mentions."_
>
> 😢 _"How do I X?"_

**Keep requests short and direct.** Much like sending an email, every contribution, no matter how simple or helpful, requires someone else's review. Many projects have more incoming requests than people available to help. Be concise. You will increase the chance that someone will be able to help you.

> 😇 _"I'd like to write an API tutorial."_
>
> 😢 _"I was driving down the highway the other day and stopped for gas, and then I had this amazing idea for something we should be doing, but before I explain that, let me show you..."_

**Keep all communication public.** Although it's tempting, don't reach out to maintainers privately unless you need to share sensitive information (such as a security issue or serious conduct violation). When you keep the conversation public, more people can learn and benefit from your exchange. Discussions can be, in themselves, contributions.

> 😇 _(as a comment) "@-maintainer Hi there! How should we proceed on this PR?"_
>
> 😢 _(as an email) "Hey there, sorry to bother you over email, but I was wondering if you've had a chance to review my PR"_

**It's okay to ask questions (but be patient!).** Everybody was new to the project at some point, and even experienced contributors need to get up to speed when they look at a new project. By the same token, even longtime maintainers are not always familiar with every part of the project. Show them the same patience that you'd want them to show to you.

> 😇 _"Thanks for looking into this error. I followed your suggestions. Here's the output."_
>
> 😢 _"Why can't you fix my problem? Isn't this your project?"_

**Respect community decisions.** Your ideas may differ from the community's priorities or vision. They may offer feedback or decide not to pursue your idea. While you should discuss and look for compromise, maintainers have to live with your decision longer than you will. If you disagree with their direction, you can always work on your own fork or start your own project.

> 😇 _"I'm disappointed you can't support my use case, but as you've explained it only affects a minor portion of users, I understand why. Thanks for listening."_
>
> 😢 _"Why won't you support my use case? This is unacceptable!"_

**Above all, keep it classy.** Open source is made up of collaborators from all over the world. Context gets lost across languages, cultures, geographies, and time zones. In addition, written communication makes it harder to convey a tone or mood. Assume good intentions in these conversations. It's fine to politely push back on an idea, ask for more context, or further clarify your position. Just try to leave the internet a better place than when you found it.

### 收集上下文

Before doing anything, do a quick check to make sure your idea hasn't been discussed elsewhere. Skim the project's README, issues (open and closed), mailing list, and Stack Overflow. You don't have to spend hours going through everything, but a quick search for a few key terms goes a long way.

If you can't find your idea elsewhere, you're ready to make a move. If the project is on GitHub, you'll likely communicate by opening an issue or pull request:

* **Issues** are like starting a conversation or discussion
* **Pull requests** are for starting work on a solution
* **For lightweight communication,** such as a clarifying or how-to question, try asking on Stack Overflow, IRC, Slack, or other chat channels, if the project has one

Before you open an issue or pull request, check the project's contributing docs (usually a file called CONTRIBUTING, or in the README), to see whether you need to include anything specific. For example, they may ask that you follow a template, or require that you use tests.

If you want to make a substantial contribution, open an issue to ask before working on it. It's helpful to watch the project for awhile (on GitHub, [you can click "Watch"](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) to be notified of all conversations), and get to know community members, before doing work that might not get accepted.

### 创建 issue

You should usually open an issue in the following situations:

* Report an error you can't solve yourself
* Discuss a high-level topic or idea (ex. community, vision, policies)
* Propose a new feature or other project idea

Tips for communicating on issues:

* **If you see an open issue that you want to tackle,** comment on the issue to let people know you're on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
* **If an issue was opened awhile ago,** it's possible that it's being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
* **If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own,** comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.

### 创建 pull request

You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:

* Submit trivial fixes (ex. a typo, broken link, or obvious error)
* Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you've already discussed, in an issue

A pull request doesn't have to represent finished work. It's usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a "WIP" (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.

If the project is on GitHub, here's how to submit a pull request:

* **[Fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)** and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original "upstream" repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from "upstream" often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. (See more detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).)
* **[Create a branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)** for your edits.
* **Reference any relevant issues** or supporting documentation in your PR (ex. "Closes #37.")
* **Include screenshots of the before and after** if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
* **Test your changes!** Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don't break the existing project.
* **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.

If this is your first pull request, check out [Make a Pull Request](http://makeapullrequest.com/), which @kentcdodds created as a free walkthrough resource.

## 在提交完之后需要善后事宜

You did it! Congratulations on becoming an open source contributor. We hope it's the first of many.

在你提交了贡献之后，下面集中情形中的某种是可能发生的：

### 😭 没有人响应你。

Hopefully you [checked the project for signs of activity](#a-checklist-before-you-contribute) before making a contribution. Even on an active project, however, it's possible that your contribution won't get a response.

If you haven't gotten a response in over a week, it's fair to politely respond in that same thread, asking someone for a review. If you know the name of the right person to review your contribution, you can @-mention them in that thread.

**Don't** reach out to that person privately; remember that public communication is vital to open source projects.

If you make a polite bump and still nobody responds, it's possible that nobody will respond, ever. It's not a great feeling, but don't let that discourage you. It's happened to everyone! There are many possible reasons why you didn't get a response, including personal circumstances that may be out of your control. Try to find another project or way to contribute. If anything, this is a good reason not to invest too much time in making a contribution before other community members are engaged and responsive.

### 🚧 其他人的要求变更了你的贡献。

It's common that you'll be asked to make changes to your contribution, whether that's feedback on the scope of your idea, or changes to your code.

When someone requests changes, be responsive. They've taken the time to review your contribution. Opening a PR and walking away is bad form. If you don't know how to make changes, research the problem, then ask for help if you need it.

If you don't have time to work on the issue anymore (for example, if the conversation has been going on for months, and your circumstances have changed), let the maintainer know so they're not expecting a response. Someone else may be happy to take over.

### 👎 你的贡献没有获得通过。

Your contribution may or may not be accepted in the end. Hopefully you didn't put too much work into it already. If you're not sure why it wasn't accepted, it's perfectly reasonable to ask the maintainer for feedback and clarification. Ultimately, however, you'll need to respect that this is their decision. Don't argue or get hostile. You're always welcome to fork and work on your own version if you disagree!

### 🎉 你的贡献被接收。

Hooray! You've successfully made an open source contribution!

## 你已经做到了!

Whether you just made your first open source contribution, or you're looking for new ways to contribute, we hope you're inspired to take action. Even if your contribution wasn't accepted, don't forget to say thanks when a maintainer put effort into helping you. Open source is made by people like you: one issue, pull request, comment, or high-five at a time.
