## 为何会有人寻求经济上的支持

很多开源的工作都是来自志愿者的辛勤付出。例如，有些人在使用项目的过程中遇到了问题，然后快速的修复了；也有些人是利用他们的业余时间在开源项目中需求挑战。

我尝试着寻找让人爱不释手的编程项目，从而是我的周末或圣诞节也能保持状态。(...)我拥有一台家用电脑，手头也并不十分宽裕。在思考了一阵子之后，我决定写一新的交互式的编程语言，（...)后来我将这门语言叫做Python。

人们从事开源相关的工作，却没有得到报酬，这事一点都不奇怪，让我们来看看缘由：

* **他们本来就有一份自己热爱的全职工作,** 这可以让他们在没有后顾之忧的情况下利用业余空闲时间来为开源做贡献。
* **他们热衷于沉浸在开源的思考中**  又或者是创造逃避环境，只是不想在他们的项目中获得金钱上的回报。
* **他们能够从开源的贡献中获得其它好处，** 比如收获名誉、投资，又或者是学习到新的技能，又或者是能够感觉到和社区很接近。

  对于一些情况，金钱上的赞助会增加责任的感觉，（...）这点对于我们来说很重要，尤其是一个全球性的社区，我们生活在一个快节奏的世界，只是想说明“不是现在，我觉得去做一些完全不同的事”。

但是，很多时候，尤其是正在进行的或者是需要花费大量时间的付出时，能够取得报酬是人们积极参与开源的唯一理由，无论是项目需求还是个人原因。

维护颇流行的项目是一项很重要的责任，需要在每周花10～20小时，而不是每个月的几个小时。

  询问任何一位开源项目的维护著，他们都会告诉你关于管理一个项目需要花费大量时间的真相。你拥有客户，你的为他们修复问题，你创建新的功能。这些都需要真正的花时间去做的事情。

有偿工作也使人们从不同的各行各业做出有意义的贡献。有些人无法承受为开源项目做没有金钱回报的工作，他们自身的情况，如当前的财务收入、债务、或者来自家庭等其它的照顾义务。这也就意外着这个世界再也无法看到那些拥有天分但是有心无力的人们的贡献了。这是一个伦理上的问题，正如 @ashedryden 在 [无偿劳动的伦理和开源软件社区](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community) 一文中所描述的，因此开源的很多工作是由那些已经在生活上取得成就的人们所贡献的，通过志愿的贡献进一步让他们获得了更加丰富的回报，而那些无法承受时间的人们错失了这样的机会，这就导致了开源社区越发的缺乏多样性。

   开源软件为技术领域贡献了巨大的好处，其实，更准确的说是所有的行业。(...) 然而，if the only people who can focus on it are the lucky and the obsessed, then there's a huge untapped potential.

如果你在寻找金钱上的支持，可以考虑两条路径。你可以作为贡献者来将你的时间作为资金，或者是找一家能够为项目提供资金的组织。

## 你的时间是最宝贵的，理应得到资助

在今天，有很多人在开源中获得了报酬，无论是兼职或全职。最为常见的做法就是，有些老板愿意为你付出的时间和工作成果掏腰包。

It's easier to make a case for open source work if your employer actually uses the project, but get creative with your pitch. Maybe your employer doesn't use the project, but they use Python, and maintaining a popular Python project help attract new Python developers. Maybe it makes your employer look more developer-friendly in general.

  Like many in open source, I was struggling with the burden of maintaining a project. When I first started doing open source, I used to just stay late to work on it or right when I got home. (...) I was able to discuss with my boss the issues I was facing and we came up with ideas on how we could incorporate open source tasks given our own use of Babel.

If you don't have an existing open source project you'd like to work on, but would rather that your current work output is open sourced, make a case for your employer to open source some of their internal software.

很多公司都在开发开源项目，从而能够打造自己的品牌，以及雇佣到高质量的人才。

@hueniverse, for example, found that there were financial reasons to justify [Walmart's investment in open source](https://hueniverse.com/2014/08/15/open-source-aint-charity/). And @jamesgpearce found that Facebook's open source program [made a difference](https://opensource.com/business/14/10/head-of-open-source-facebook-oscon) in recruiting:

> It is closely aligned with our hacker culture, and how our organization was perceived. We asked our employees, "Were you aware of the open source software program at Facebook?". Two-thirds said "Yes". One-half said that the program positively contributed to their decision to work for us. These are not marginal numbers, and I hope, a trend that continues.

If your company goes down this route, it's important to keep the boundaries between community and corporate activity clear. Ultimately, open source sustains itself through contributions from people all over the world, and that's bigger than any one company or location.

  Getting paid to work on open source is a rare and wonderful opportunity, but you should not have to give up your passion in the process. Your passion should be why companies want to pay you.

If you can't convince your current employer to prioritize open source work, consider finding a new employer that encourages employee contributions to open source. Look for companies that make their dedication to open source work explicit. For example:

* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) is a company built around [an open source project](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost)
* [Rackspace](https://www.rackspace.com/en-us) published its [open source contribution policy](https://blog.rackspace.com/rackspaces-policy-on-contributing-to-open-source/) for employees

Projects that originated at a large company, such as [Go](https://github.com/golang) or [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), will also likely employ people to work on open source.

Finally, depending on your personal circumstances, you can try raising money independently to fund your open source work. For example:

* @gaearon funded his work on [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) through a [Patreon crowdfunding campaign](http://redux.js.org/)
* @andrewgodwin funded work on Django schema migrations [through a Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/andrewgodwin/schema-migrations-for-django)

## 为你的项目寻找资助

Beyond arrangements for individual contributors, sometimes projects raise money from companies, individuals, or others to fund ongoing work.

Organizational funding might go towards paying current contributors, covering the costs of running the project (such as hosting fees), or investing into new features or ideas.

一些获得组织资助的项目案例：

* **[webpack](https://github.com/webpack),** which raises money from companies and individuals [through OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/webpack)
* **[Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue),** created by @yyx990803, which is [funded through Patreon](https://github.com/open-source/stories/yyx990803)
* **[Ruby Together](https://rubytogether.org/),** a nonprofit organization created by @indirect that pays for work on [bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler), [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems), and other Ruby infrastructure projects

As open source's popularity increases, finding funding for projects is still experimental. A few current options include:

* **Raise money for your work through crowdfunding campaigns or donations.** This strategy works well if you have a strong audience or reputation already, or your project is very popular.
* **Apply for grant funding.** Some software foundations and companies offer grants for open source work, such as the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/grants/), and [Stripe](https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-2016).
* **Raise sponsorships from companies and individual donors** through a software foundation. Or **start a business** to support the project.

For more detailed options and case studies, @nayafia [wrote a guide](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand) to getting paid for open source work. Different types of funding require different skills, so consider your strengths to figure out which option works best for you.

## 建立经济上的支持

Whether your project is a new idea, or has been around for years, you should expect to put significant thought into identifying your target funder and making a compelling case.

Whether you're looking to pay for your own time, or fundraise for a project, you should be able to answer the following questions.

### 影响

为什么说这个项目有实际用处？你的用户或潜在的用户会喜欢它？5年之后它会是什么样子？

### 牵引

Try to collect evidence that your project matters, whether it's metrics, anecdotes, or testimonials. Are there any companies or noteworthy people using your project right now? If not, has a prominent person endorsed it?

### Value to funder

Funders, whether your employer or a grantmaking foundation, are frequently approached with opportunities. Why should they support your project over any other opportunity? How do they personally benefit?

### Use of funds

What, exactly, will you accomplish with the proposed funding? Focus on project milestones or outcomes rather than paying a salary.

### How you'll receive the funds

Does the funder have any requirements around disbursal? For example, you may need to be a nonprofit or have a nonprofit fiscal sponsor. Or perhaps the funds must be given to an individual contractor rather than an organization. These requirements vary between funders, so be sure to do your research beforehand.
